          I was born in Trinidad and Tobago and moved to Maryland, where I spent
          most of my childhood. When I was in 7th grade, my family moved to
          Guinea to follow my fatherâ€™s work. Not long after we arrived my school
          was closed for many months as a result of a nation wide strike.
          Keeping my education a priority, my father began teaching me from home
          while he organized for me to live with a family friend in Ghana and
          finish the school year there. Due to the frequency and
          unpredictability of civil unrest in Guinea, my father left his job and
          we moved back to Trinidad so that I could have consistency through
          high school. Although we visited many times in my childhood, I was
          excited to finally have the opportunity to live in and properly
          experience my culture. Six years after I left the Washington, DC metro
          area I returned to attend The George Washington University School of
          Business where I majored in accounting. With gaming as a lifelong
          hobby I had always been interested in coding but did not have the time
          to teach myself. After I graduated I finally decided to learn and
          applied for the full time coding bootcamp offered by GWU.

          At first I struggled. I had never seen javascript and I only had a
          vague idea of how HTML worked. However, I soon found myself thoroughly
          enjoying the most difficult challenges I had ever faced. Every
          unfamiliar obstacle I encountered was an opportunity to learn
          something new. I knew I had found something I love to do and that my
          drive to excel would be fueled by my passion and curiosity. Just
          before my completion of the coursework I was hired as a member of the
          teaching staff for the following cohort. Working as a teaching
          assistant made me realize that the only thing more rewarding than
          surmounting a new challenge is helping a student do so. Now that my
          students have graduated I am eager to see what the next steps in my
          career have to offer.

          I also have two dogs that I love very much, they live in Trinidad with
          my parents. Toolum (right) loves to hunt and is convinced that she is
          a big dog. Rocher (left) is a picky eater and enjoys barking at things
          only she can see.
